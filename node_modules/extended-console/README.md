extended-console
================
Extends default `console` logging with various utilities.

Features
========
- Prepend timestamp to output using [Moment.js' `format`](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/)
- Prepend log level (ie, `log`, `inf`, `war`, `err`)
- Attach events to be called when something is logged using any of the 4 log functions

Usage
=====
First install it using npm

    npm install extended-console
	
Then simply require it and log away!

    require("extended-console");
    
    console.log("Log away!");

Options
=======
Options are located within the `console.extended` object.

- `showTimestamp` ( *boolean* ) Whether to prepend a timestamp to output
- `timestampFormat` ( *string* ) Format for timestamp. Uses [Moment.js' `format`](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/)
- `showLogLevel` ( *boolean* ) Whether to prepend the log level to output

For example

    require("extended-console");

    console.extended.timestampFormat = "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm";
    console.log("Custom timestamp format!");

Events
======
This module extends the console to act as a standard event emitter. You can use standard [`events.EventEmitter`](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter) methods such as `.on` and `.addListener` on the `console.extended` object. The event names are as follow: `log`, `inf`, `war`, `err`. Be careful not to call any of the logging functions inside of an event callback for that logging function itself, for it will result in a stack overflow.

Example

    console.extended.on("err", function() {
    	process.stdout.write("Error event listener called\n");
    });
    console.error("Error event listener test");
